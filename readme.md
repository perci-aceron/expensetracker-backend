Each new branch for dr must be made from master

After you've done your homework on your branch, you need to make a pull request (PR). Then add a mentor for code review. Only after the mentor approves the PR, you can merge the branch with the homework in the master.

Read the mentor's comments carefully. Fix the comments and commit to the branch with the homework. Changes will be pushed to PR automatically after you commit the fixes to github
After the fix, add the mentor to the code review again.

- When submitting homework, there is a link to PR
- JS code is clean and clear, Prettier is used for formatting

### Teams:

- `npm start` &mdash; server start in production mode
- `npm run start:dev` &mdash; start the server in development mode
- `npm run lint` &mdash; run a code check run with eslint, must run before each PR and fix all linter errors
- `npm lint:fix` &mdash; the same linter check, but with automatic fixes for simple errors
